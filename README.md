# Personal Requirement Planner

Have you ever had problems with juggling your requirements together and you often complain that your teachers give too much homework to the point you just give up and go back to sleep? Well, worry no more! We, Giga Bites, are here to help you!

## About Our Project

Our project is focused on creating a program that helps students and workers manage their schedules more effectively. Our program will serve as a personal calendar where users can input their requirements and sync them with specific due dates. The goal is to make time management easier and to promote productivity to individuals struggling to keep up with their works by organizing inportant tasks in an annual calendar. ☆*: .｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆
